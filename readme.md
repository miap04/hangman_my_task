Assignment

Before you write any code, you should think about the problems, try to understand them

Tasks:
* The game should have no magic numbers or strings. 
* Do not accept the same letter twice. (i.e. if the player has guessed c in cat allready that is a wrong guess. if the player has guessed o inncorectly allredy that is a mistake, but o should not show up in the list.)
* Fix the glitch in the graphics. (there is something wrong in the hangman drawings.)
* Extend the number of attempts the player has to guess the word (remember that extends implies after the existing, and that each attempt is associated with a graphical representation)
* Allow the player to play again (Do you want to play again?)
* Show stats at the end (i.e. when the player exits the game)
* Do one or the otther 
    - A)Get a random word from an array (list) of words.
    - B)Retrieve the list of possible words at startup from the file words.txt. You may have to move the file to a suitable folder. (tip: readFileSync is a function to look at.)
* Refactor the code. Remember that we are optimizing for readability and want to see you using functions in a good way.
